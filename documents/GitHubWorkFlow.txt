Working with GitHub
 

Our working procedure:

1 - Choose or create a card in To-Do list (Trelo).

2 - Move the card to doing and assign it to the person who will be working on it. If choosing a card already in the doing list, modify the assignment for the current developer. 

3 - insert the next number in the list to that task. Do not change the number assigned if working in a doing task previously assigned to another developer.

4 - Create an issue in the git hub for that developer including the number of the task, its name and the package.

5 - Follow the following steps:

Git Hub workflow. (GitHub recommends)

- Create Branch
- Make changes
- Create a pull request
- Address review comment
- Merge your pull request
- Delete you branch

6 - if work is ready and there is no need to present to de team: move card to done. If needs team opinion/approval move to waiting approval. If the work is not yet done, let it in the doing list. 

Remarks 1 - we will be working over de "develop" branch. The "main branch will be used only for production ready features
Remarks 2 - on your code remember to use comments before the block you are woking for.
	//Brief description of what the block does
	//Kanban Task (include different tasks. That way we can track the work done and solve doubts with the respective developer).
	//Name and Date Time of last developer working on that block
